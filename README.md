# react-http-post
An exercise, in which I learned how to send a POST and GET request to an external database from a React App. 

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise, I learned how to send a POST http request to an external database. 
I used the React fetch() API to send POST and GET requests. 
I used Firebase to create a practice database to work with.

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74827533/170996406-3fa0e646-804f-479d-a494-dc06eea27e19.png)
